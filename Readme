fp-sin 0.1.0

Simple Sinatra shell with all the goodies.

I added quite a few things.

1. Now uses rack-fiber_pool, em_mysql2, em-resolv-replace, em-synchrony, and em-http-request for async requests.
2. ActiveRecord is included via sinatra-activerecord
2. Simple localization with i18n.
3. Added bundler and rvm support.
4. Added less support.
5. Dalli for speedy memcache support.
6. Tux is included for console debugging.

To start the server:

thin -R config.ru start

This will fire it up on port 3000.

To run the tests:

rake test

To launch a console:

rake console
